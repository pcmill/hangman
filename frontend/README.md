Welcome to the newest rage on the internet: Hangman!

Can you guess the word? The faster you guess the higher your score will be!

To test this undoubtably viral sensation clone this repository and, assuming you have installed NodeJS, run `npm install`. After this you can run `ng serve`, this will compile the code and make it available on [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

If you want to run all the tests in this project simply run `ng test`. This will start Karma for you and run the available tests in Chrome.

### Features to work on

There are some improvements to be made.

- Introduce a way for the user to clear the highscores. 
- Pull words from a larger list that aren't solely specific to a certain 'on-demand manufacturing company' from the Amsterdam area.
- At the moment it is harder to get a highscore with longer words. Maybe we can introduce a weighted variant that counters this.
